Reviews of the book state that the Dr Valter Longo's book promotes selling the fasting protocol kit, but the protocol
is briefly outlined here:

General Protocol

* For serious cases (e.g. Stage 4 melanoma) 25/5 day cycling of normal/fasting diet.
* Healthy individuals may only fast 1-2x/year

The macronutrient breakdown of the protocol consists of:

* Day 1 - 1100 calories
  * 11% Protein
  * 46% Fat
  * 43% Carb
* Day 2-5 - 720 calories
  * 9% Protein
  * 44% Fat
  * 47% Carb

This works out to:

* Day 1
  * 30g Protein
  * 56g Fat
  * 118g Carb
* Day 2-5
  * 16g Protein
  * 35g Fat
  * 85g Carb

Future TODO:

* Come up with meal plans that follow the macronutrient breakdown.
