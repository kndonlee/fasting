Based on:

https://www.foundmyfitness.com/episodes/valter-longo-2

Reviews of the book state that the Dr Valter Longo's book promotes selling the fasting protocol kit, but the protocol
is briefly outlined here:

The protocol consists of:

* Day 1 - 1100 calories (11/46/43% protein/fat/carb)
* Day 2-5 - 720 calories (9/44/47% protein/fat/carb) macronutrient breakdown.

This works out to:

* Day 1 - 30g protein, 56g fat,  118g carb
* Day 2-5 - 16g protein, 35g fat, 85g carb

Future TODO:

* Come up with meal plans that follow the macronutrient breakdown.
